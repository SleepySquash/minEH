# minEH
minEH (minimal Engine Holder) is a game engine that contains window and events abstraction (only Cocoa for now), renderer (OpenGL and Vulkan - you can choose one simply at renderer's context creation time: GL::Context or Vk::Context), graphics primitives (currently 2D Sprite, 3D Camera and 3D Mesh), entity component composition system. Networking and audio systems will be supported as well in the future.
